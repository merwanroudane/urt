Comprehensive Unit Root Tests Explorer is an interactive Streamlit application created by Dr Merwan Roudane designed for econometricians, data scientists, and researchers to intuitively explore the theory and practice of unit-root testing in time-series analysis. Built on a responsive, sidebar-driven interface, the app offers:

Visual Demonstrations of stationary versus non-stationary processes—random walks, ARMA models, fractional-integration, near-explosive roots, and seasonal patterns—complete with customizable parameters and real-time plotting.

Embedded Statistical Tests, including Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), KPSS, Phillips-Perron, Elliott-Rothenberg-Stock (DF-GLS), and Ng-Perron, each accompanied by full test statistics, p-values, critical values, and interpretive guidance.

Simulation Modules for size-and-power analysis across varying persistence levels and significance thresholds, enabling users to assess test performance through interactive charts and heatmaps.

Diagnostics and Differencing Tools, featuring ACF/PACF plots, first-difference comparisons, Jarque-Bera normality checks, and descriptive statistics to deepen understanding of series behavior before and after transformation.

Structured Navigation through theory, test descriptions, an interactive simulator, advanced special-case exploration (e.g., fractional integration, structural breaks), and a curated library of references and resources.

This app streamlines the hands-on learning curve for advanced time-series methods, fosters reproducible research workflows, and serves as both a teaching aid and a rapid-prototyping environment for applied econometric analysis.
